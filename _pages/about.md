Hi there!I am a 3D printing professional specialising in architectural structure additive manufacturing. 

I am a fourth year doctoral reseracher at Institution for Manufacturing [(IfM)]((https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/aa22))at University of Cambridge. As part of [Fluids in Advanced Manufacturing](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/fiam/), my work is supervised by Prof.[Ronan Daly](https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/rd439) and Prof.[Abir Al-Tabbaa]((https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/aa22)).I am dedicated to additive manufacturing for construction applications, aiming for print quality improvement by better harnessing the time-dependent rheological properties of cementitious materials and interfacial bonding strength improvement through various techniques. 

Previously, I obtained my BSc in Civil Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University supervised by Prof.Bing Chen. 


Having a BS in civil engineering and pursuing his PhD at the Institute for Manufacturing (IfM), Cambridge, Richard is passionate about automation in the construction sector and providing an efficient, customised & greener solution to solve the current housing crisis worldwide. Affordable houses should be accessible to every community and family across the globe. 

He’s also a young entrepreneur in search of business opportunities. Currently, he’s an active member of the Cambridge University Technology & Entrepreneurship Club (CUTEC) and serving as the Vice President of the Chinese Students & Scholars Association of Cambridge.

Richard (Yu) is a Cambridge Trust Scholar, currently studying in the final year of PhD at the University of Cambridge. He works across the groups of Prof Ronan Daly and Prof Abir Al-Tabbaa. His advisor is Prof Bill O’Neill. He joined the Fluids in Advanced Manufacturing (FIAM) group at the Institute for Manufacturing (IfM) in 2020. 
 
He has been recognised by many awards since joining Cambridge, including the winner of the IET International Travel Award 2024, finalist in the Student Presentation Competition at the International Conference on Advanced Manufacturing 2023,1st Prize in Best Poster Competition at the IfM PhD Conference 2021, ASTM International Emerging Professional (ASTM EP) Award, Christ's College Old Member's Sporting Award, etc. 
 
As a young professional with active industry engagement, he was selected into many professional organisations. He serves under American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) Committee C01 for Cement, Committee D30 for Composite Materials, Committee F42 for Additive Manufacturing Technologies; British Standards Institution (BSI, UK National Committee) Committee AMT/8 for Additive manufacturing; ISO TC 261 for Additive Manufacturing; and American Concrete Institute (ACI) Committee 564 for 3-D Printing with Cementitious Materials.
