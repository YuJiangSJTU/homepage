Hi there! I am a 3D printing professional specialising in 3D printing of cementitious materials with time-dependent viscoelastic rheology. 

**<span style="color: red;">I am actively looking for full-time postdoc opportunities in top-tier research institutes. I am also open to exciting industry jobs should great opportunity arises.</span>**

I am a final year doctoral reseracher at Institution for Manufacturing [(IfM)]((https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/aa22))at University of Cambridge. As part of [Fluids in Advanced Manufacturing](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/fiam/), my work is supervised by Prof.[Ronan Daly](https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/rd439) and Prof.[Abir Al-Tabbaa]((https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/aa22)).I am dedicated to additive manufacturing for construction applications, aiming for print quality improvement by better harnessing the time-dependent rheological properties of cementitious materials and interfacial bonding strength improvement through various techniques. Previously, I obtained my BSc in Civil Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University supervised by Prof.[Bing Chen]([(https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/aa22)](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Bing-Chen-Lab-4)). 

As a emerging entrepreneur and co-founder of[Layer Construction](https://www.layerconstruction.com), I am passionated about automation in the construction sector and providing an efficient, customised & greener solution to solve the current housing crisis worldwide. 

I have been recognised by many awards since joining Cambridge, including finalist in the Student Presentation Competition at the International Conference on Advanced Manufacturing 2023, 1st Prize in Best Poster Competition at the IfM PhD Conference 2021, ASTM International Emerging Professional (ASTM EP) Award.
 
As a young professional with active industry engagement, he was selected into many professional organisations. He serves under American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) Committee C01 for Cement, Committee D30 for Composite Materials, Committee F42 for Additive Manufacturing Technologies; British Standards Institution (BSI, UK National Committee) Committee AMT/8 for Additive manufacturing; ISO TC 261 for Additive Manufacturing; and American Concrete Institute (ACI) Committee 564 for 3-D Printing with Cementitious Materials.
